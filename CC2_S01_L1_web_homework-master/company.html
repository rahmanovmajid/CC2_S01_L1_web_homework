			<h2>Why UFAZ?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>A unique educational initiative</strong>  </li>
				<p class=><strong>A unique educational initiative</strong> <br />UFAZ is an ambitious project initiated by the Presidents of the French Republic and the Republic of Azerbaijan in 2014. 
					It is administered by the historic university of Azerbaijan - the Azerbaijan State Oil and Industry University (ASOIU) from the Azerbaijani side and the prestigious University of Strasbourg (Unistra) from the French side. </p>
			    <hr>
				<li>Two Undergraduate Diplomas</li>
				<p>
						<strong>Two Undergraduate Diplomas</strong> <br />	UFAZ students will receive two national diplomas (French and Azerbaijani) upon graduation – one by the Azerbaijan State Oil and Industry University and another by University of Strasbourg or University of Rennes 1 (depending on their specialty). 
				</p>
				<hr>
				<li>Summer School in Strasbourg</li>
				<p><strong>Summer School in Strasbourg</strong> <br />Every summer 40 students that have shown best academic results throughout the year will travel to France for two-week long Summer School in Strasbourg. Students will practice French and get acquianted with French culture and history as well as visit international organizations and scientific institutes of Strasbourg</p>
			    <hr>
			    <li>Centre for scientific experimental teaching and research</li>
			    <p><strong>Centre for scientific experimental teaching and research</strong> <br />UFAZ offers vast laboratory facilities that are exclusive in Azerbaijan for their technical equipment and research possibilities. We currently have two fully equipped Chemistry and Physics Laboratories as well as practical room for computer science classes built according to the standards prevailing in our French partner universities. We are expecting to launch a six-floor laboratory that would become one-of-a-kind in Azerbaijan and will give our students and faculty even more opportunities for research activities. </p>
				<hr>
				<li>Academic excellence </li>
				<p><strong>Academic excellence</strong> <br />UFAZ aims at acquiring academic excellence not only in Azerbaijan but also in the region thanks to the quality of the full-time and visiting highly-qualified French and Azerbaijani Professors. Those dedicated and experienced instructors from Azerbaijan and France (Strasbourg and Rennes 1 universities) are delivering their lectures in English. French course is a part of the curriculum. It is taught as a second language throughout the program. This enhances students' chances to continue their studies in a French speaking country at the master level. <br />
				<br />    
				Our potential candidates are Azerbaijani students who just graduated from high school with a strong scientific background and foreign high-school graduates. Local students would have to successfully complete the exam of the State Examination Center (SEC). Both local and foreign prospective students need to demonstrate basic knowlegde of English and pass the UFAZ recruitment exam organized by Strasbourg University in Baku. Foreign students are welcome to apply on a paying basis. </p>
				<hr>
				<li>Opportunities for self-expression</li>
				<p><strong>Opportunities for self-expression</strong> <br />Our mission is to create such conditions in the University where students' can work their imagination and experiment their ideas in laboratories and during extra activities in the Clubs. Here at the University they are taking their first steps on the way of implementing their most original ideas (start ups, scientific projects, etc.) As part of self-expression, we encourage students to create and fulfill new projects like photo and drawing contests, charity activities, filmmaking, theater, French choir lessons,...etc.  </p>
				<hr>
				<li>Central location and accessibility </li>
				<p><strong>Central location and accessibility</strong> <br />UFAZ has moved to beautifully restored and refurnished historical building that opened its doors in the center of Baku in September 2017. Many representatives of the older generations are familiar with this architectural pearl of Nizami street that has always been referred to as “The third building” of ASOIU. It is located in the central street of Baku, which is unusually quiet and has many neighboring cozy coffee places/shops for every student’s taste! It is also just five-seven minutes away from the city’s central “28 may” underground station and Baku youngsters’ favorite “28” Shopping mall (for more cozy spots and after-school activities). </p>
