			<h3 class="back">Purpose: </h3>
			<ol>
				<li>To determine the concentration of an unknown solution of HCl by titrating with a 1 mol/L
						solution of NaOH.</li>
				<li>To plot a graph of pH as a function of the volume of NaOH added and generate a titration
						curve.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3 class="back">Introduction: </h3>
			<p>Neutralization reactions involve the reaction of an acid and a base to produce a salt and water.</p>
		    <p>NaOH<sub>(aq)</sub>+HCl<sub>(aq)</sub>&rarr;NaCl<sub>(aq)</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub></p>
	        <p>(Net equation: H<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>+OH<sup>-</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> &rarr; H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub>)</p>
	        <p>Titration is a common laboratory method of quantitative chemical analysis that is used to
					determine the unknown concentration of an identified analyte. Since volume measurements play a
					key role in titration, it is also known as <strong>volumetric analysis</strong>. A reagent with known concentration is
					called a <strong>titrant</strong>. A known concentration and volume of titrant reacts with a solution of an analyte to
					determine concentration.</p>
			<p>Using a volumetric burette, it is possible to determine the exact amount that has been consumed
					when the endpoint of titration is reached. The endpoint is the point at which the titration is
					complete, as determined by an indicator. At the titration endpoint, the quantity of reactant in the
					titrant added during the titration is stoichiometrically equivalent to the quantity of reactant in the
					analyte. This is ideally the same volume as the equivalence point â€“ the volume of added titrant at
					which the number of moles of titrant (n <sub>t</sub> , in this PW n<sub>b</sub> ) is equal to the number of moles of analyte
					(n<sub>a</sub>), is in stoichiometric ratio of the given chemical reaction: n<sub>a</sub> = n<sub>b</sub></p>
			<p>The equivalence point in a titration is often signalized by the colour change of an indicator
						Information about the analyte (i.e. concentration) can be calculated at the equivalence point.</p>
			
			<p>The progress of an acid-base titration is often monitored by plotting the pH of the solution being
					analysed as a function of the amount of titrant added (called a titration curve).
					Phenolphthalein - a pH indicator. In acidic and neutral solutions, the indicator is colourless, but
					in a basic solution, the colour is a vibrant pink. The higher the pH is, the stronger the pink colour
					is. The equivalence point will be when the colour is a very faint pink colour. Keep your flask with
					acid and indicator over a white piece of paper to ensure you can see the colour change</p>

			<h3 class="back">Safety: </h3>
			<p>Hydrochloric acid solution is a strong acid. Sodium hydroxide solution is a strong base. Both are
					harmful to skin and eyes. Affected areas should be washed thoroughly with copious amounts of
					water.</p>
